IPL Data Analysis Project (Python)

Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) match and ball-by-ball data to uncover key insights about teams, players, and match outcomes. Using Python and data analysis libraries, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand performance trends across multiple IPL seasons.
The analysis includes player performance, team dominance, dismissal patterns, and venue impact, presented through clear visualizations for better understanding.
